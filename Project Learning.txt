############ MINI MICROSERVICE APP ##############

Here in this application a user can create posts and can comment on posts. So we can divide our application into 3 main parts ::

(a). React application (frontend)
(b). Express application for "Posts" service (backend)
(c). Express application for "Comments" service (backend)

We will use "async" way of communication between these 2 microservices.
